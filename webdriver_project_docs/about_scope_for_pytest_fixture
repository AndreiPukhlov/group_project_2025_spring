Fixture Scopes in Pytest

Scope	When is it created?	When is it destroyed?
function |  (default)	Before each test function	|  After each test function
class    |  Before the first test in a class	    |  After the last test in the class
module	 |  Before the first test in a module	    |  After the last test in the module
session	 |  Once before all tests	                |  After all tests finish


When to Use Different Scopes

function (default) ->  Use when each test needs a fresh instance (e.g., browser session).

class        ->        If all tests in a class share a single resource.

module       ->        If a fixture should last for an entire test file.

session      ->        If the fixture should be initialized only once across the entire test run (e.g., logging setup).
